# baur

baur (bash AUR) is an experimetnal AUR helper for Arch Linux (or it's derivatives) written in bash.

# DONT ACTUALLY UNIRONICALLY USE THIS
THIS LACKS A LOT OF FEATURES WHICH ARE MISSING IN OTHER AUR HELPERS. THIS WILL BE ADDED IN THE FUTURE.
CONSIDER THIS BETA SOFTWARE.

## Why is it experimental?
Because I'm a dumb fuck and I might have written something that could fuck something up really badly.

# Installation (do it at your own risk)
Clone the repo, and do `sudo make install`.

To upgrade, clone this repo again and do `sudo make clean install`.

# License
This helper is licensed in The GPLv2 license, meaning what happens to your device because of my shit awful script leaves me with ZERO responsibility.
